Write a program that outputs the score of a bowling game given a valid sequence of rolls.

- You do not need to validate the input
- You do not need to implement the game - you're calculating the scores after the game has been completed
The Game

- The bowling game consists of 10 frames(turns).
- In each frame the player has two rolls(tries) to knock down 10 pins.
- If the player knocks down all 10 pins in one roll, the frame is then completed with a single roll.
- The score for the frame is the total number of pins knocked down plus bonuses.

Bonuses :

- A **spare** is when the player knocks down all 10 pins in two rolls. The bonus for that frame is the number of pins knocked down by the next roll.
- A **strike** is when the player knocks down all 10 pins on his first roll. The bonus for that frame is the value of the next two rolls
- **Tenth Frame bonus**: the player is allowed to roll one extra ball for a **spare**, or two extra balls for a **strike** rolled in the tenth frame. Note that rolling another strike does not award any additional rolls and that the total number of rolls in this frame must not exceed 3.

Questions:

Get the data as a data structure (not implementing game)?
-
bonus means, e.g., for spare, first roll of next frame is added to score
